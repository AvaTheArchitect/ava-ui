# Phase 5: Advanced Notation Parsers - Complete Implementation

## Update: Replace Existing Notation Parser Stubs

Replace the current stub implementations with comprehensive, production-ready notation parsing system:

- Replace basic stub files with full implementations
- Implement proper TypeScript exports in index.ts files
- Add sophisticated music theory and notation parsing algorithms
- Create comprehensive type definitions for all notation elements
- Build utilities for format conversion and validation
- Integrate advanced guitar technique detection
- Support real-time parsing for live music input

## Replace Files:

- src/notation/parsers/staffNotationParser.ts - Complete music staff parser with clef detection, key signatures, time signatures, and note parsing
- src/notation/parsers/chordSymbolParser.ts - Advanced chord symbol parser with Roman numeral analysis, jazz extensions, and progression detection
- src/notation/parsers/techniqueParser.ts - Comprehensive guitar technique parser for all standard notation symbols and tablature markings
- src/notation/parsers/rhythmNotationParser.ts - Full rhythm analysis with complex time signatures, polyrhythms, and beat subdivision
- src/notation/parsers/index.ts - Proper TypeScript module exports for all parsers

## Update Files:

- src/types/notation/notationTypes.ts - Complete TypeScript interfaces for all notation data structures
- src/utils/notation/notationUtils.ts - Advanced utilities for notation conversion, validation, and music theory calculations

## Requirements:

### Staff Notation Parser:

- Parse treble, bass, alto, and tenor clefs with proper transposition
- Handle all major and minor key signatures with circle of fifths logic
- Support compound time signatures (6/8, 9/8, 12/8) and irregular meters (5/4, 7/8)
- Extract note pitches, durations, accidentals, and articulations
- Handle multi-voice notation and chord stacks
- Support ledger lines and extended range notation
- Parse dynamics markings (pp, p, mp, mf, f, ff, fff)
- Handle tempo markings and expression text

### Chord Symbol Parser:

- Parse complex jazz chords (Cmaj13#11, Ab7alt, F#m7b5)
- Handle slash chords and bass note specifications (C/E, Am/C)
- Support polychords and upper structure triads
- Analyze chord progressions with Roman numeral analysis
- Detect common progressions (ii-V-I, vi-IV-I-V)
- Handle chord extensions and alterations (#5, b9, #11, b13)
- Support multiple chord naming conventions
- Generate chord tone and scale recommendations

### Technique Parser:

- Parse all standard guitar techniques with proper symbols
- Handle palm muting notation (PM, P.M., dots under notes)
- Detect vibrato symbols (~~~~~, wavy lines)
- Parse bend notation (12b14, full bend, half bend, quarter bend)
- Handle hammer-ons and pull-offs (5h7, 7p5, slurs)
- Support slide notation (3/7, 7\3, legato slides)
- Parse tremolo picking and alternate picking patterns
- Handle harmonics notation (natural <12>, artificial [12])
- Support tapping notation (T with numbers)

### Rhythm Parser:

- Handle all note values from whole notes to 64th notes
- Parse dotted rhythms and complex subdivisions
- Support tuplets (triplets, quintuplets, septuplets)
- Handle syncopation and off-beat accents
- Parse rest notation and fermatas
- Support swing and shuffle rhythms
- Handle metric modulation and tempo changes
- Parse complex polyrhythmic patterns

### Type Definitions:

- Complete interfaces for Note, Chord, Measure, Staff, Score
- Enums for all musical elements (Clef, KeySignature, TimeSignature)
- Types for guitar techniques and tablature data
- Interfaces for rhythm patterns and metric structures
- Union types for different notation formats
- Generic types for extensible parsing systems

### Utility Functions:

- Convert between different tuning systems
- Transpose notation to different keys
- Convert between notation formats (MusicXML, MIDI, Guitar Pro)
- Validate notation data integrity
- Calculate note frequencies and intervals
- Generate chord voicings and fingerings
- Create tablature from standard notation
- Export to various file formats

### Integration Requirements:

- Seamless integration with ScrollingTabDisplay component
- Real-time parsing for live input and editing
- Performance optimization for large score files
- Error handling with descriptive music theory messages
- Support for undo/redo operations
- Memory-efficient parsing for mobile devices
- Extensible architecture for custom notation elements

### Testing Requirements:

- Unit tests for all parsing functions
- Integration tests with real music notation files
- Performance benchmarks for large scores
- Edge case testing with complex musical examples
- Regression tests for notation accuracy
- Cross-format conversion validation tests

### Code Quality:

- Follow advanced TypeScript patterns with generics and utility types
- Implement proper error handling with custom exception classes
- Use efficient algorithms for music theory calculations
- Include comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- Follow functional programming principles where appropriate
- Implement proper separation of concerns and modularity
- Use design patterns suitable for music software architecture
