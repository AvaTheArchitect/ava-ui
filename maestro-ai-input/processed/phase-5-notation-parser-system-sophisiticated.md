# Phase 5: Notation Parser System - Replace Stub Implementations

## Update: staffNotationParser

Replace existing stub with comprehensive staff notation parser:

- Parse treble and bass clefs with proper transposition
- Handle major/minor key signatures using circle of fifths
- Support time signatures including compound meters (6/8, 9/8, 12/8)
- Extract note pitches, durations, accidentals, and articulations
- Parse dynamics markings (pp, p, mp, mf, f, ff, fff)
- Handle multi-voice notation and chord stacks

## Update: chordSymbolParser

Replace existing stub with advanced chord symbol parser:

- Parse complex jazz chords (Cmaj13#11, Ab7alt, F#m7b5)
- Handle slash chords and bass specifications (C/E, Am/C)
- Support chord extensions and alterations (#5, b9, #11, b13)
- Analyze chord progressions with Roman numeral analysis
- Detect common progressions (ii-V-I, vi-IV-I-V)
- Generate chord tone recommendations

## Update: techniqueParser

Replace existing stub with guitar technique parser:

- Parse palm muting notation (PM, P.M., dots under notes)
- Handle vibrato symbols (~~~~~, wavy lines)
- Parse bend notation (12b14, full bend, half bend)
- Detect hammer-ons and pull-offs (5h7, 7p5, slurs)
- Support slide notation (3/7, 7\3, legato slides)
- Parse harmonics notation (natural <12>, artificial [12])

## Update: rhythmNotationParser

Replace existing stub with comprehensive rhythm parser:

- Handle all note values from whole notes to 64th notes
- Parse dotted rhythms and complex subdivisions
- Support tuplets (triplets, quintuplets, septuplets)
- Handle syncopation and off-beat accents
- Parse rest notation and fermatas
- Support swing and shuffle rhythm patterns

## Create Files:

- src/notation/parsers/formatConverter.ts - Convert between MusicXML, MIDI, Guitar Pro formats
- src/notation/parsers/validationEngine.ts - Validate notation data integrity and music theory rules
- src/notation/parsers/realtimeParser.ts - Real-time parsing for live music input and editing
- src/types/notation/advancedTypes.ts - Extended interfaces for complex notation elements
- src/utils/notation/musicTheoryUtils.ts - Advanced music theory calculations and transposition
- src/utils/notation/fingerprintGenerator.ts - Generate unique identifiers for musical phrases

## Requirements:

- Replace all existing stub implementations with production-ready code
- Maintain existing API contracts while adding enhanced functionality
- Create comprehensive TypeScript type definitions for all notation elements
- Implement efficient parsing algorithms optimized for large score files
- Add proper error handling with descriptive music theory error messages
- Generate unit tests for all parsing functions with real musical examples
- Update all relevant index.ts files with proper exports
- Integrate seamlessly with existing ScrollingTabDisplay component
- Support memory-efficient parsing suitable for mobile devices
- Include JSDoc documentation for all public methods and interfaces

## Features:

- Advanced music theory integration with circle of fifths calculations
- Real-time notation validation and error correction
- Cross-format compatibility with industry-standard notation software
- Performance optimization for complex orchestral scores
- Extensible architecture for custom notation symbols
- Support for microtonal and non-Western musical systems
